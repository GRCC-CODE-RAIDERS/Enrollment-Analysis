# Enrollment Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Enrollment Analysis Project, an initiative by the Coding Club at Grand Rapids Community College. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting trends and patterns in past enrollment reports. Our goal is to gain insights into student enrollment behaviors and potentially guide future college planning and resource allocation.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Analyze historical enrollment data to identify trends, patterns, and predict future enrollment figures.
- **Data Source:** Historical enrollment reports from Grand Rapids Community College.
- **Technologies Used:** Python for data analysis, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-Learn for predictive modeling.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
- Scikit-Learn library

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone [URL]`
2. Install required Python libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
