EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Notes 
• CORRECTION: Updated on De cember 5, 2022, the titles on Graphs 2 and 3 were switched and the 
heade rs “Credits ” and “Billing Units ” were sw itched on table 1. 
• Data is collected from PeopleSoft for credit information and a combination of Continuity and PeopleSoft 
for Noncredit information. If a source other than these systems is reported, it will be noted. 
• The timeframe of reference for most data (where appropriate) is the fall count date, September 8 , 
2022. 
• Close to the start of Fall 2022, GRCC experienced a reorganization which transitioned our previous two 
academic schools into four academic schools. 
• The Reconnect and Futures for Frontliners initiatives have helped bring more non -traditional students 
back to GRCC. 
• There has been a slight rebound in several metrics since Fall 2020, but that is s tarting to level out. This 
was, of course , due to our changing behavior since the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Fall 2022 Observations 
• Based on demographics, our average student is a part -time enrolled white female between the ages of 
18-24. 
• Part-Time students stil l represent a majority of the credit enrollment at 72.3%. 
• Females still represent a majority of the credit student enrollment at 56.4%. 
• We are seeing an upward trend in high school aged students (under 18), which has grown 6.6% since 
Fall 2021 and 119% si nce Fall 2012. This matched national trends as Dual Enrollment grows in 
popularity. This is most likely related to the increased K -12 partnerships with GRCC which includes our 
growing Middle College Program . 
• Students aged 25 and older have remained above the COVID -level (up 13.9% since Fall 2020), despite 
a decline from Fall 2021 to Fall 2022 ( 13.9%). 
• We’ve seen steady growth in the population of students who self -identify as Hispanic, with an increase 
of 26. 3% since Fall 2020. Conversely, we’ve seen the proportion of students who self -identify as White 
steadily decrease over the last decade (41.7%) with a drop of 8.9% between Fall 2021 and Fall 2022. 
This matches trends for Kent County where the White populat ion has decreased from 76.1% in Fall 
2010 to 72.6% in Fall 2021 and the Hispanic population has grown from 9.7% in Fall 2010 to 11.3% in 
Fall 2021 (source:  usafacts.org). 
• One-year retention rates have been on the rise since Fall 2020. Since Fall 2021, t he overall retention 
rate increased 2.1% , the female retention rate increased 3.1% , and the male retention rate increased 
0.5%. 
• Since Fall 2021, o ne-year retention rates for students self-identifying as Native American increased 
45.7%. There was also a sligh t increase for students self -identifying as more than one race in the same 
timeframe , up 11.5%. 
• Since Fall 2021, one -year retention rates for part -time students increased 5.9%.

• Lakeshore Campus enrollment is trending back to pre -pandemic levels, which in F all 2022 is only 
12.3% lower than Fall 2018. 
• The traditional student population has been falling steadily over the last several years (36.6% since Fall 
2012). This is a combination of several factors such as birth rate decreases for Kent County (down 
6.8% since Fall 2010, source:  usafacts.org), a declining pool of high school graduates (down 16.5% 
since 2017, source:  Mischooldata.org), increases in 4-year institution enrollment, and changing 
perceptions of the value of a college education. 
• The proportion of remote learning classes has been decreasing since Fall 2020 as the proportion of in -
person classes has steadily increased in the same timeframe. 
• We’ve seen a downward trend over the last decade in headcount, credits, and billing units, w hich 
matches national trends for community college enrollment. Since Fall 2021, headcount is down 7.1%, 
credits are down 8.1%, and billing units are down 8.2%.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
Notes  
• Data is collected from PeopleSoft for credit information . If a source other than these systems is 
reported, it will be noted.  
• The timeframe of reference for most Winter 2023  data (where appropriate) is the winter count 
date, January 19, 2023 . 
• GRCC transitioned our  previous  two academic schools into four academic schools  starting Fall 
2022.  
• The Reconnect and Futures for Frontliners initiatives have helped bring more non -traditional 
students back to GRCC.  
• There has been a slight rebound in several metrics since Fall 2020, but that is starting to level 
out. This was , of course , due to our changing behavior since the COVID -19 pandemic.  
• The virtual instruction modality was introduced in Fall 2020. In addition, rem ote learning was 
predominantly offered Winter 2021 to promote social distancing.  
• Lakeshore Campus opened for Fall 2021 in one location. Prior to that, the Lakeshore location 
was comprised of Thompson M -TEC, Midtown Center, GVSU Meijer Campus, Holland Caree rline 
Tech Center, and West Ottawa High School.  
• Winter 2021 was the first Winter to reflect impacts of COVID . 
 
Winter 2023  Observations  
 
• Based on demographics, our average student is a part -time enrolled white female between the 
ages of 18 -24. 
• Part-Time students still represent a majority of the credit enrollment at 7 5.8%.  
• Females still represent a majority of the credit student enrollment at 5 5.8%. 
• Students under 18 have steadily increased over last decade, which can be attributed to the 
strengthening m iddle and concurrent college programs.  
• We’ve seen steady growth in the population of students who self -identify as Hispanic, with an 
increase of 2 5.5% since Winter  2021 and exceeded pre -COVID measures . Conversely, we’ve 
seen the proportion of students who self-identify as White steadily decrease over the last 
decade (4 3.4%) with a drop of 6.0% between Winter 2022  and Winter 2023 .  
• Fall-to-Winter  retention rates have been on the rise since Winter  2021. Since Winter  2022, the 
overall retention rate increased 3.0%. The female retention rate increased slightly at 0.3 %, and 
the male retention rate increased 6.5%, surpassing the pre -COVID retention rate .  
• Most race/ethnicity groups experienced improvement in Fall-to-Winter retention rates , ranging 
from 3.6% for st udents identifying as Hispanic to 20.3% for students identifying as Native 
American.  
• Since Winter 2022, Fall-to-Winter retention rates for part -time students increased 1.6% and 
full-time students increased 3.6% . 
• After a decline at the onset of COVID, the Lakeshore Campus enrollment has been increasing 
since Winter 2021, 39.5% overall.    
 
Winter 2023 Enrollment Report | 3/ 8/23 5 
 
• The proportion of remote learning classes has been decreasing since Winter  2021 as the 
proportion of in -person classes has steadily increased in the same timeframe.  
• We’ve s een a downward trend over the last decade in headcount, credits, and billing units, 
which matches national trends for community college enrollment. Since Winter  2022, headcount 
is down 3.1%, credits are down 3.3%, and billing units are down 3.5%.

Report Notes  
• Data is collected from PeopleSoft for credit information and a combination of Continuity and PeopleSoft 
for Noncredit information. If a source other than these systems is reported, it will be noted.  
• The timeframe of reference for data is the fall count date, September 7, 2023, unless noted otherwise . 
Fall 2023 Executive Summary  
 
• Based on  demographics, our average student  continues to be  a part -time enrolled white female 
between the ages of 18 -24. 
• We achieved 95.84% of our Fall 2023 enrollment stretch goal and exceeded the Fall 2022 enrollment 
figures by 3.23% for headcount, 2.87% for billing units, and 3.26% for credit attempted which has 
been acknowledged and celebrated.  The enrollment growth since Fa ll 2022 has been observed 
nationally for community colleges  according to several higher education publications.  Some initiatives 
that allowed GRCC to achieve the enrollment growth are:  
o An enrollment stabilization fund allowed units of GRCC to fund recruitm ent strategies where the 
opportunity might not have existed in the past.  
o GRCC staff reviewed the Enrollment Cancellation process to identify populations that needed 
some additional communication to understand college processes.  
o GRCC leveraged marketing strategies that included direct mail and digital advertising to connect 
with students who may have been eligible for the Reconnect grant or the Michigan Achievement 
Scholarship.  
o GRCC admissions staff were active at school, community -based, and employer eve nts all 
summer  ensuring that our institution was present in the communities . 
o Administrative leadership focused on intentional enrollment growth through our Schedule 
Optimization Strategic Initiative.  
• We achieved a 10.95% increase in returning students enrollment compared to Fall 2022.  Several 
factors have been noted in literature to cause this increase, such as t he reinstatement of student loan 
payments that were stalled during the pandemic and discontinued pandemic supports .  
• Our dual enrollment and guest student populations experienced growth in Fall 2023 compared to Fall 
2022, 11.00% and 15.41% respectively.  
• In general, high school  enrollment  has increas ed by 207%  over the last decade as our High School 
partnerships continue to grow , which also follows na tional trends .   
• The male student population grew by 5.44% from last fall, which aligns with years prior to Fall 2022.  
• Enrollment for students self -identifying as Hispanic/Latino/Latina grew 11. 22% from last fall, continuing 
their upward trend since Fall 2020. 
• Enrollment for students self -identifying as Black/African American grew 11. 17% from Fall 2022.  
• We did see a decrease in our occasional student enrollment (defined as students who experienced an 
enrollment gap at GRCC between major semesters) ; however , research will be done  to determine if 
this is directly related to the increase in our returning students so  recruitment and outreach  efforts  are 
strategic and effective . 
• The decrease in Job Training enrollment is a result of discontinued Introduction of Construction and the 
Computer Support Program was paused due to instructor illness.
